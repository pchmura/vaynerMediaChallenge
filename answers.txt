Explanation:
    Instead of parsing through the files iteratively, I chose to save all the data in a dictionary
    as the look-up operation is 0(1).
    While parsing through the csv files I sorted the data into different categories which
    would speed up the look up of specific queries, which are questions asked in the challenge.
    Some of the queries would have required access to both data sets simultaneously, which I addressed by using campaign objects that hold all relevant data to that campaign.
