The goal of this exercise is to simulate the creation of a report, by working with two datasets, and drawing some basic insights.
Given the stated assumptions, please provide your answers to the following questions (in a .txt file), as well as your code.
Please use either Python or Ruby.

source1.csv contains a list of campaigns, audiences and impressions served
    - the audience is composed of three elements separated by the delimiter "_"
    - the elements represent the state, hair color and age range of that campaign, respectively

source2.csv contains stats by day for each audience, broken out by ad_type
    - actions are a json string in the format [{'action': name, source: value}]
    - for example, {'action': 'conversions', A': 20} means source A reported 20 conversions

Do not disregard any data as invalid.

1. what was the total spent against people with purple hair?
    -sum all campaigns with people who have purple hair
        -find all campaign-ids that have used people with purple hair
2. how many campaigns spent on more than 4 days?
    -sum all campaigns with < 4 days
        -go to campaign and check each one if dates list is longer than 4
3. how many times did source H report on clicks?
    -sum source H click count action from table 2
        -go to sources find the action click and return count
4. which sources reported more "junk" than "noise"?
    -sum sources that have both junk
        -iterate through sources and check if the source has both "junk" and "noise"
5. what was the total cost per view for all video ads, truncated to two decimal places?
    -sum all video ads cost
        -go to video key and sum campaigns
6. how many source B conversions were there for campaigns targeting NY?
    -sum all NY B conversions
7. what combination of state and hair color had the best CPM?
    -save the state stats like hair color
BONUS - include a timestamp of the run time for your solution :)

dictionary of all sources and sum their actions
